A few days ago I decided to create a short website about me, so you can find
something when you go to [http://yux.ch/](http://yux.ch).

Because I just used the feature set of Octopress which Jekyll also provides,
I decided to start from scratch with Jekyll 2.0.

I based the new design on [bourbon](http://bourbon.io/),
[neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) and [bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/).
It was a pleasure to use these three libraries to create something handmade!

Maybe you noticed the redirection from `yux.ch` to `blog.yux.ch`. This happens
because GitHub Pages supports just one CNAME per hosting.
As I want to have my page accessible without under `yux.ch` I will host it by
myself soon.
For this I will configure my server at [nine.ch](http://nine.ch) in a setup which
[Samuel has described on his blog](http://www.crafted.ch/blog/managing-a-few-servers-with-puppet/).
