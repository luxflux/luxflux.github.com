A few days ago I decided to create a short website about me, so you can find
something when you go to [http://yux.ch/](http://yux.ch).

As I just used the feature set of Octopress which Jekyll also provides, I
decided to switch away from Octopress to Jekyll standalone.

The new design is based on [bourbon](http://bourbon.io/),
[neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) and [bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/).
It was a pleasure to use these three libraries to create something handmade!

Unfortunately GitHub Pages does not support multiple CNAMEs. As I don't want
to have a forward from `yux.ch` to `blog.yux.ch` configured for ever, I will
configure my server at [nine.ch](http://nine.ch) in a setup which
[Samuel has described on his blog](http://www.crafted.ch/blog/managing-a-few-servers-with-puppet/).
Afterwards I will move my page from GitHub Pages to it.
